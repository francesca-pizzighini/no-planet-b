# There is no planet B

Since half of 20th century scientists are warning us that human activity is interfering with normal climate change of the planet, and we still haven't done anithing drastic to change things. We put information togheter to help clarifying the situation for everyone who still have doubts. Navigating the different pages to see data about the variation in temparature, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentration in the air, polar ice situation and ocean temperature. We hope this will help in sensitize people to act, and to vote for someone who'll care for our future.

## The project

This project is the last part of my journey in learning to code with [Start2Impact University](https://www.start2impact.it). This is my final project for the front-end developer course.
<br>
Created in 2024.

### Prerequisite

The assignment for this project is to build a multi-page website to show data about climate change in charts. I decide to dedicate a page for each topic: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentration in the air, global temperature, polar ice condition and ocean temperature.
All the data were provided by [Global Warming and Climate Change API](https://global-warming.org).

### Technical requisite

- Create a functioning webApp
- Interact with [API](https://global-warming.org)
- UX and UI easy to use
- Write a README file
- Responsive designe
- Organized project structure
- Show charts with any library preferred

<br>
Every addictional feature is welcome.

## Download it yourself

The first thing you need is Node.js installed, if you haven't please check [this](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) page.
After the installation open the terminal in your computer and make sure you are in the folder you want to download the project in.

### Git clone

Type in the terminal
`git clone https://github.com/francesca-pizzighini/no-planet-b.git`
Then open the project folder in your code editor and make sure the terminal is now indicating this folder.

### Install

Type in the terminal
`npm i `
to install all the dependencies indicated in the package.json file

### Open the project

Type in the terminal
`npm run dev`

## A quick guide to use

The website is really simple to use, but I'll illustrate how the pages works to make everything even clearer.<br>
First of all open the website [here](https://there-is-no-planet-b.netlify.app).
<br>

### Home page

You'll than see the home page where you can click one of the links on the bottom of the page to see a graph for every main topic: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentration in the air, global temperature, polar ice condition and ocean temperature. Every page is designed to be easy to understand for everyone who could see it. At the top there is a chart indicating the data we are talking about, and right below that there is a short description of the data and why it is important to keep monitoring them.

### Light/dark mode

In every page there is also a switcher to change the view from light to dark mode, just to make sure to provide the best experience to everyone who wants to be informed on climate changes.
