## The project

This project is part of my journey in learning to code with [Start2Impact University](https://www.start2impact.it). This is my project to prove my knowledge about React.
<br>
Created in 2024.

### Prerequisite

The assignment for this project was to built a website for vegetarian people to help them find new recipes. It was required a searchbar to find only the vegetarian recipes in the API, and clicking on the single recipe will open a new page with information about the specific dish.
<br>
All the information were provided by [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs).

### Technical requisite

- Using React
- Implementing a searchbar which search in all vegetarian recipes, and only them. Reading carefully the documentation of the API was required for this
- Every recipe needs to show name and image of the dish
- Every recipe is clickable and redirect to a specific page where you can see more details about that dish
- Responsive designe
- Organized project structure
- UX and UI easy to use
- Write a README file

Every addictional feature is welcome, especially:

- React Redux
- React Hooks
- Axios
- React Router
- Context API

## Design inspiration

I'm not a good graphic designer, so part of my preparatory work consist of search for inspirational works. For this project I don't have a specific source, but i browsed Pinterest in search for inspiration.
I would cite:

- This [layout](https://www.pinterest.it/pin/655836764512991222/) for the design of the navbar
- This [layout](https://www.pinterest.it/pin/647040671491364971/) fot the website design
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for the logo design

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS

## A quick guide to use

The website is really simple to use, but I'll illustrate how the pages works to make everything even clearer.<br>
First of all open the website [here](https://foodie-veggie.netlify.app).

### Home Page

In the homepage will randomly appear 3 vegetarian recipes everytime the page is loaded. This is for everyone who needs inspiration to find the right recipe, or just want a little caos in their life. <br>
Every recipe shows name, image and specify if is vegan or gluten free. I thought it wuold be useful fo everyone who need to know those specification and can't use a selector as in recipes page.

### Search a specific recipe

Here in the page dedicated to recipes the user has parameters to direct the research to what exatly they need. <br>
The research won't start until the user press the search button near the searchbar, so they can select if they need the recipe to be gluten free, vegan, if they want to search for a particular cuisine and if they want to search for a specific word in the recipe. <br>
And that's it. As i said it's super simple, the recipes will show up and the only thing the user have to do is click the recipe is interested in to see in details ingredients and instruction to cook the dish!

### About page

The last page is simply dedicated to introduce an hypothetical society who decided to create this website. I thought that if I was the one interested to sensitize people to eat less meat i wuold like to introduce myself and my motivation. I think in this kind of project is important to make sure users know they are supported in their journey to eat better, that is not always easy.
